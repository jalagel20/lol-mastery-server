# LoL Mastery Server

Welcome to my personal project! I wanted to make a fun project where I can view a list of the champions I have mastery points on from highest to lowest.

What you are looking at here is the server side code, directly hitting the Riot API endpoints. If you are more interested in checking out the frontend code, that will be linked here shortly.

## Getting Started

If you would like to contribute, please feel more than welcomed to submit a pull request with any changes you think can help!
